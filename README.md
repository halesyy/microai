# microai

A small AI wrapper alternative. This is an experimental AI wrapper.

It aims to use primarily functions, instead of classes, to reduce operational complexity. It also uses typing, and aims to build smaller nodes that can be interconnected.

- Python 3.12
- Small, modular, and easy to use
- Primarily uses classes, not functions
- Typing
- Basic graphing

Working on it from context of [this article](https://www.jackhales.com/article/ai-agents-research-2024#:~:text=So%20%2D%20I%20think%20that%20is%20where%20I%20will%20spend%20a%20bit%20of%20time%20%2D%20working%20on%20a%20microframework%20for%20composing%20chains%2C%20which%20uses%20functions%20over%20very%20verbose%20classes.) on my website.
